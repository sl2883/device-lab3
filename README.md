#### a. Based on the readings from the serial monitor, what is the range of the analog values being read?
0-1000

#### b. How many bits of resolution does the analog to digital converter (ADC) on the Arduino have
1024 = (2^10) = 10 bits

#### What voltage values do you see from your force sensor?
0-5V

#### What kind of relationship does the voltage have as a function of the force applied? (e.g., linear?)

FSR- logorithmic. Goes up as soon as you touch it, but then it doesn't

Flex Sensor-Linear

Photo - linear

#### In Examples->Basic->Fading the LED values range from 0-255. What do you have to do so that you get the full range of output voltages from the LED when using your FSR to change the LED color?
